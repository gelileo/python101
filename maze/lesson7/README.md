# Lesson 7: Testing Maze Solvability

## Objectives
- Use a selected algorithm to test if a maze generated by the editor is solvable.
- Display the result (e.g., "Maze is solvable" or "Maze is not solvable").

## Lecture

In this lecture, we will:
1. Understand what it means for a maze to be solvable.
2. Learn how to use the BFS algorithm to test maze solvability.
3. Explore how to display the result of the test to the user.

### Key Concepts/Topics

#### What Does "Solvable" Mean?
A maze is solvable if there is a path from the start position to the end position. This means:
- The start and end positions are connected by a series of valid moves.
- There are no walls blocking the path.

#### Using BFS to Test Solvability
The BFS algorithm can be used to test if a maze is solvable by checking if it can reach the end position from the start position.

**Code Example: Testing Solvability with BFS**
```python
from bfs import bfs
from maze_data import MAZE1, START_POSITION, END_POSITION

# Test if the maze is solvable
path = bfs(MAZE1, START_POSITION, END_POSITION)
if path:
    print("Maze is solvable.")
else:
    print("Maze is not solvable.")
```

#### Displaying the Result
Once the test is complete, you can display the result to the user in a clear and simple way.

**Code Example: Displaying the Result**
```python
def display_result(is_solvable):
    if is_solvable:
        print("Congratulations! The maze is solvable.")
    else:
        print("Oops! The maze is not solvable. Try editing it.")

# Example usage
is_solvable = bool(path)
display_result(is_solvable)
```

### Example Walkthrough
Imagine this maze:
```
1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1
```
- Start at `(1, 1)` and end at `(2, 2)`.
- BFS will:
  1. Start at `(1, 1)`.
  2. Check neighbors: `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`.
  3. Move to `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`.
  4. From `(1, 2)`, check `(2, 2)` (the end).
  5. Stop because it found the end!

By the end of this lecture, you will know how to test if a maze is solvable and display the result to the user.

## Homework
- Modify the code to highlight the unsolvable areas of the maze.
